# Identifier of dangerous diseases on new principles

This project is a system for identifying dangerous diseases, including COVID-19, 

based on a combination of features: temperature, blood pressure, and external signs of the disease.

## Description

The system uses data on temperature, blood pressure, and external signs 

of the disease to identify dangerous diseases. 

Data can be entered manually or automatically through trackers and sensors.

## Features

* Identification of dangerous diseases, including COVID-19.

* Manual or automatic data entry through trackers and sensors.

* Analysis of a combination of features for more accurate identification.

* Ability to integrate with other medical systems.

## Usage

1.  Enter data manually or connect trackers and sensors.

2.  The system will automatically analyze the data and provide an identification result.

3.  View the result and take the necessary measures.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
